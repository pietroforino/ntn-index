          ANTONIO CIOPPA (1991) is a Milan-based architect working across interiors,
          installations, product, and graphic design. His work is shaped by a radical
          industrial* grammar that merges pure, archetypal forms with functional
          aspects to create a language that is both clear and experimental. Through a
          cross-disciplinary approach, his practice explores the intersection between
          utility and expression, structure and aesthetics.

          production, or prefabricationâ€”such as factories, workshops, and
          laboratories. In addition, a significant part ofthis focus is on modular,
          prefabricated, and monobloc elements.
